# Bearliever

Did you stay or did you go? Were you a true believer during the bear market?

Bearliever allows users to mint an NFT if they are able to prove that they were active between the period of low activity (and prices) between Aug 10, 2018 (block 6120000) to July 10, 2020 (block 10430000). Utilizing [Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz), users are able to generate a Zero Knowledge proof and submit that data into the Bearliever contract, which verifies that they did at least 32 transactions during that time by looking at the difference in account nonce at those two blocks.
