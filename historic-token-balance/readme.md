# Historic Token Balance

This example allows users to connect their wallet, input up to 8 ERC20 contract addresses (AxiomV1Query supports up to 64 rows, but we use 8 for simplicity in this example) and block number pairs and generate a ZK proof of much of each token they (or any other wallet that they put in) owned at that block number.
